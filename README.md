## Hello, my name is Calum.

By day, I am the Founder of Trelent, the fully-encrypted AI assistant for secure teams.

By night, I am a software developer and experimenter. I love to connect applications in new and interesting ways, keep up to date on the latest conversations and papers in NLP, and try to make sense of the philosophy around my own (and others) work in the space of machine learning. Typically this means engrossed in conversation with someone about these topics, walking around deep in thought, or writing.

For what it's worth, if you have both read this far, and the philosophy of artificial intelligence, language or technology fascinsates you and you want someone to talk to about it, please do reach out! If you include "philosophy" in the subject, I'm more likely to see your email. In fact, if you've read *this* far, I'd probably like to talk to you anyway, so if you haven't already please reach out!
