## Hey there! My name is Calum.

By day, I am the CEO at Trelent. I apply state of the art machine learning models to real-world problems, and commercialize the resultant applications. Trelent's mission is to put software development in the hands of the next billion people, and I work every day to make that happen.

By night, I am a software developer and experimenter. I love to connect applications in new and interesting ways, keep up to date on the latest conversations and papers in NLP, and understand the huge volumes of data my day job creates. My go-to is Python, though I've been known to dabble in TypeScript (or rarely, Vanilla JS) as well.
